#Create a basic while loop that prints the numbers 1 to 10.
#Hint, you'll have to create a counter variable for your start variable, and then increment it each time




#Using a while loop to cycle through a string.....
#Create a string variable, storing the sentence "I go to school in Ardgillan Community College"
#Create a while loop, looping for the amount of characters in the sentence (Hint: use the len() function).
#On each cycle of the loop print each letter from the sentence (Hint: use the string variable with square brackets [ ] at the end)









#Using a while loop to get the code "stuck" until it receives the correct info (called a Sentinel loop).
# This loop will keep going until the user enters a number great than 100
#Step1: create a variable with value 0
#Step2: create a while loop, which enters if the variable is less than 100
#Step3: Print "Too low!", then prompt the user to enter a value, and store this input to your existing variable. 
#Step4: If the loop exits, print "You now have a big enough value!"
