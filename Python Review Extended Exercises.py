#Task 1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).


#Task2. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. 
#If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, 
#on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.
#Hint: use these two lines to generate a random number (uncommenting the lines).....
#from random import *
#randInt = randint(1,10)



#Task 3. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and prints the reverse to screen



#Task 4. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers. Take this list as your numbers to use...
#numList = [2,3,4,5,7,8,19,24,27,29,31,43,44,56,58,61,66,77,78]





#Task 5. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
