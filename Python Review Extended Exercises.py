#Task 1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).


#Task2. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. 
#If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, 
#on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.
#Hint: use these two lines to generate a random number (uncommenting the lines).....
#from random import *
#randInt = randint(1,10)



#Task 3. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and prints the reverse to screen



#Task 4. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers. Take this list as your numbers to use...
#numList = [2,3,4,5,7,8,19,24,27,29,31,43,44,56,58,61,66,77,78]





#Task 5. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


#Task 6. Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters. Go to the editor
#Sample Data : Python 3.2
#Expected Output :
#Letters 6
#Digits 2


#Task 7.Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users. Go to the editor
#Validation :

#At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
#At least 1 number between [0-9].
#At least 1 character from [$#@].
#Minimum length 6 characters.
#Maximum length 16 characters.


#Task 8 Write a Python program to calculate a dog's age in dog's years. Go to the editor
#Note: For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.
#Expected Output:
#Input a dog's age in human years: 15                                    
#The dog's age in dog's years is 73
